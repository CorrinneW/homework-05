Workday planner assignment

## The Assignment
Write script for a workday planner app to keep track of the day's schedule.

## What I Did
1. Built the structure of the table using HTML

2. Used moment.js to build date and time functions that update live.
  • Shows today's date at the top of the page.
  • Color of timeblocks change based on whether they are in the past, present or future.

3. Save buttons save tasks to local storage and tasks persist in their original positions even if the page is reloaded or closed.

## The Result

A clean, efficient and dynamically updated application built on moment.js and jquery.
